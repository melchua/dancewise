# On Event Types appearing on the view, the fix I implemented was removing the space between "Event Type" and that is allowing the code to render on the event show page.

# In order to get the event frequency to show up on the Event Index page I had to change the null value change_column_null(:events, :event_frequency_id, false, default = 6) of the event frequency ID to not allow false values and give it a default value, I chose 6 since that is the value of the one-time event, I also added validation for event frequency and event type IDs to prevent the error messages from showing up #
